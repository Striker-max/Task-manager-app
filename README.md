# Task-manager-app
Python-based task management system for a small business. The program handles user login, task assignment, and displays tasks from text files. Admin users can register new users and view system statistics, such as the total number of tasks and users. Tasks can be viewed by all users, and the system provides a clear, easy-to-read format for tasks assigned to each user.
